            Amazon<br>
            <a href="amazon.com">amazon.com</a>
            <img src="images/amazon.jpg">
            <p>The images used on Amazon's homepage exemplifies the Rule of Third's principle. Amazon has a lot to offer people that are coming to their website and when the user is in mobile they have to tell a story with images and they are all fit to their windows perfectly using the Rule of Third's principle.</p>

            <a href="behance.net">behance.com</a>
            <img src="images/behance.jpg">
            <p>Behance uses proximity to indicate to the user what categories they can sift through. At the top of the page they have a lot of tiles next to each other in a scrollable container to indicate that it is separate from the content down below.</p>

            <h2>Fitt's Law</h2>
            Spotify<br>
            <a href="spotify.com">spotify.com</a>
            <img src="images/spotify.jpg">
            <p>Spotify uses Fitt's Law to make their call to action more prominent on the page. In order to see more content on the mobile view you need to scroll. I think that was a deliberate decision knowing that their target audience is probably coming to the page looking for info.</p>
